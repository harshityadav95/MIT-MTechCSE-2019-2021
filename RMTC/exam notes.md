- Research  :  Research is defined as the systematic and
  objective process of inquiry for aid in making
  decisions.

- Research: a way to gather evidence for your practice , Evidence-based practice (EBP) 

- Applications of research

  Research types  :  

  1. basic Research : expand the limits of knowledge , not involved in the solution
  2. Applied Reserarch :

- The research process: characteristics and requirements

- - - - Controlled (limited study of variables )
      - Rigorous (appropriate and justified)
      - Systematic – This implies that the procedures adopted to undertake an investigation follow a
        certain logical sequence
      - Valid and verifiable – This concept implies that whatever you conclude on the basis of your
        findings is correct and can be verified by you and others
      - Critical – Critical scrutiny of the procedures used and the methods employed is crucial to a
        research enquiry.

**Pure research** involves developing and testing theories and hypotheses that are intellectually challenging to the researcher but may or may not have practical application at the present time or in the future.

Most of the research in the social sciences is **applied**

**descriptive study** attempts to describe systematically a situation,
problem, phenomenon, service or programme, or provides information about, say, the living conditions
of a community, or describes attitudes towards an issue

**correlational study** is to discover or establish the existence of a
relationship/association/interdependence between two or more aspects of a situation What is the relationship between stressful living
and the incidence of heart attack? 

**Explanatory research** attempts to clarify why and how there is a relationship between two aspects of a situation or phenomenon. This type of research attempts to explain, for example, why stressful living results in heart attacks;

**exploratory research**. This is when a study is undertaken with the objective either to explore an area where little is known or to investigate the possibilities of undertaking a particular research study

The structured approach to enquiry is usually classified as q**uantitative research** and unstructured as **qualitative research**

### Chapter 5

**Keywords: active variables, attribute variables, categorical variables, causation,**
**constant variables, continuous variables, dependent variables, dichotomous,**
**extraneous variables, independent variables, interval scale, intervening variables,**
**measurement scales, nominal scale, ordinal scale, polytomous, ratio scale, unit of**
**measurement**

In research terminology, change variables are called independent variables, outcome/effect variables
are called dependent variables, the unmeasured variables affecting the cause-and-effect relationship
are called extraneous variables and the variables that link a cause-and-effect relationship are called
intervening variables. Hence:

**Variables vs Concepts**

1. **Independent variable** – bringing about change(s) in a phenomenon or situation.
2. **Dependent variable** – the outcome or change(s) brought about by introduction of an independent
variable.
3. **Extraneous variable** – several other factors operating in a real-life situation may affect changes in
the dependent variable. T
4. **Intervening variable** – sometimes called the confounding variable), it links
the independent and dependent variables. 

**Active variables** – those variables that can be manipulated, changed or controlled.
**Attribute variables** – those variables that cannot be manipulated, changed or controlled

**constant variable** – has only one category or value, for example taxi, tree and water;
**dichotomous variable** – has only two categories, as in male/female, yes/no, good/bad, head/tail,
up/down and rich/poor;
**polytomous variable** – can be divided into more than two categories, for example religion
(Christian, Muslim, Hindu); political parties (Labor, Liberal, Democrat); and attitudes (strongly
favourable, favourable, uncertain, unfavourable, strongly unfavourable)

• Qualitative variables are like categorical variables such as gender: male/female Or Quantitative (interval and ratio scales)

• Nominal or classificatory scale, e.g. religion:
Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jew, etc.
• Ordinal or ranking scale (categories in order)
e.g. socio economic status: upper/middle/low
• Interval scale (has equal units of
measurements with an arbitrary starting
point) e.g. Temperature in Fahrenheit
• Ratio scale (equal units of measurement with
fixed starting point at zero) e.g. height in cm

### Chapter 6

**Keywords: alternate hypotheses, hunch, hypothesis, hypothesis of point-prevalence,**
**null hypothesis, operationalisable, research hypothesis, Type I error, Type II error,**
**unidimensional, valid**

**Hypotheses** bring clarity, specificity and focus to a research problem,
but are not essential for a study

1. It is a tentative proposition.
2. Its validity is unknown.
3. In most cases, it specifies a relationship between two or more variables.

A hypothesis should be simple, specific and conceptually clear.

A hypothesis should be capable of verification.

A hypothesis should be related to the existing body of knowledge.

A hypothesis should be operationalisable.

![image-20191103184630799](image-20191103184630799.png)

Broadly, there are two categories of hypothesis:

1. research hypotheses;

2. alternate hypotheses.Its main function is
   **to explicitly specify the relationship that will be considered as true in case the research hypothesis**
   **proves to be wrong Conventionally, a null hypothesis, or hypothesis of no difference, is formulated as an alternate**
   **hypothesis**
   
   #### Null hypothesis H0
   • The null hypothesis states that there is no
   difference between two situations, groups,
   outcomes, or the prevalence of a condition or
   phenomenon

A research design is a plan, structure and strategy of investigation so conceived as to obtain
answers to research questions or problems.

- conceptualise an operational plan to undertake the various procedures and tasks required to
  complete your study;
- ensure that these procedures are adequate to obtain valid, objective and accurate answers to the
  research questions
