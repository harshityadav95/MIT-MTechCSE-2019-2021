Project Title :Geo Location Based Project Indexing Solution
 ->India is a rapidly developing nation, there are lot of hackathons , innovative solutions  and problems being solved and data being generated  by student teams from colleges all over India , many projects at College level  start big but only few make it to a finished product and others dont make it due to variety of reasons ,  there are many problem statements common to variety of situations all over india which every team or individual takes an unique approach to solve it and hundreds of unique way to solve a problem may come when a problem statement or competion happens but only top 3 are selected and highligted rest gets lost on the internet which might work or sometimes may be ahead of time in terms of technology or cost, but can solve a problem (ex a student made an app to diagnose disease in a local  crop or device to monitor soil nutrition in Punjab, that solution might not win the competion at that time but the idea may be good and 2 years later a smillar problem can be solved in remote parts of Assam using the same technolgy or project which would take months of time to host another event or the students participating in that event can inprovise and learn from the shortcomings of similar projects or contact that team for support accelerating the rate of innovation  ) our GPS based Indexing and respository of solutions will help reduce the time in research , knowledge transfer , and finding the best ideas to solve a problem  , because a sometimes the best idea comes from places one can't even imagine , india is land of infinite oppurtunites and posibilties waiting to be discovered all we need is backbone and platform to connect and discover the ideas , Imagine what a billion minds when asked to solve a single problem can come up , and the same idea once indexed and easily accesible can be used to help others part of world to that dont have the resources to spend so much on research and building the solution 

 Creating a GPS based  code-base and dataset indexing  portal where students and teams can tag the area or region where the solution they have worked on , the target area for the project they have created, or a problem faced in that area for which they have the solution  , or are currently working like an uber liek map service where you can see the onging active project or innovative solution being worked upon near you or in that region , or past solutions or unique ideas being created or prototyped which solved in a problem or current projects being paused due to lack of resources which can also be solved using the solution .bringing ideas and solutions together to create a place for 24x7x365 place where ideas and mind can compete and share and solve common problems .
